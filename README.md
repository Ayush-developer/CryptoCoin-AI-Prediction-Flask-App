# CryptoCoin AI Prediction Flask App

## Overview
The CryptoCoin AI Prediction Flask App is a web application designed to analyze historical Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) data and predict future cryptocurrency prices. This tool enables users to visualize data and make informed investment decisions through machine learning predictions.

## Features
- Access and visualize historical OHLC data for various cryptocurrencies.
- Display candlestick charts, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) graphs, and Bollinger Bands.
- Predict future OHLC data for the next 30 days using machine learning models.
- Visualize predicted closing prices, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for backend development.
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for building the web app.
- **Machine Learning**: Models used for predicting future cryptocurrency prices.
